# FastAPI Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, developed using FastAPI for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The application is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes are implemented to ensure seamless updates and deployment to a remote machine hosted on a Any Provider instance.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: [Specify CI/CD tools, e.g., GitHub Actions]
- **Hosting**: Any Provider

## Features
- Interactive UI designed using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- RESTful API endpoints managed via FastAPI.
- Dockerized application environment for easy development and deployment.
- Automated deployment pipeline for efficient version control and production updates.
